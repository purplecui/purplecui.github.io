I read somewhere(most likely insta reels) that you can only find fulfillment in life if you become part of something greater than yourself. It's this delusional thought, for when we feel ourselves to be so little and unfulfilled, a grand thought of being part of another gives us meaning, that detached feeling for completion, the final piece of puzzle. The concept of both the big thing to cling onto and our small partial-fulfillment are abstract. Maybe they exist only in our mind. When I read this for the first time, I got thinking if this really makes sense, if I someday will gain this sense of fulfillment ever. If my sense of being enough for anything will finally come to fruition. Then I had a short feeling of insight, a momentarily bliss when sunlight reflected just at the right shade, color contrast and angle in my room. When air changed its pace; slow breeze to gentle; a fulfilled one that passed by my face, and just the right type of music in my ears.
