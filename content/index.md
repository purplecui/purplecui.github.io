#### Welcome to my site: a concoction of ideas, thoughts and boring boring writing.

I have been wanting to build a site like this for quite a while. But the nihilist approach to life in me was embedded so deep that nothing made sense to me, neither my thoughts, my actions nor my efforts towards achievement and fulfillment. But as I traverse through life things have begun to change. After many contemplation and some epiphanies and the realizations in-between it has come to my belief the importance of documenting my thoughts and the way I feel about things.

It dawned upon me very slow and way late the importance of writing; I realized that as I traverse through time and explore many different things in life I come to different conclusions to the same topics. And it is of most importance to me to document my thoughts at many different point of time so as to analyse the person I once am and recur to many different perceptions I develop in time. After thinking about how to proceed in life, i had a discernment of what kind of person i want to be. The image of an individual is different for different other people who knows of him. And one way of correcting the impression and reducing the gap in preordained fate is reading about what the person is; especially when it is written by the person himself. 

## About me

Well, everything(shakes head:horizontal) here is about me hehe. I believe that the persona of any individual cannot be simply summarized into such bland topic as "about me". The prolonging of topic such as this depicts narcissism and feeds the one thing that is beneficial only when kept in control--human ego. The depth of characteristics of a person lies not in fancy topics but in profundity in their words. And words are all I have to offer and here is the amalgamation of my knowledge until this point. So, feel free to discover and derive.
