Watching intersteller gives us a glimpse of multidimensional reality. How there exist things beyond our perceivable capacity. It has multidimentional aspect of physical world to it, but another equally paramount reality is multidimensinal thinking capacity or in simpler terms how we view the past and the present. The way we traverse through thoughts and memories, the vagueness and the complimentary certainty after our thoughts. How we become absolutely certain of wanting to do one thing and synchronously certain of not wanting to do another thing. And within it the even more interesting aspect of reversal of those decisions after certain time has passed, maybe hours, days or months. This multidimensionality approach to become cognizant of certainty in beliefs, opinions and on boarder spectrum ideals is a show of a minuscule diffidence as we humans pass through time.  How we experience time in a certain moment isn't necessarily how we will experience it when we look back at it. The ideals, opinions and morals have unnoticeable changes at the least and the drastic distortion at the most. 

This reminds me of a poem from "Before Sunrise":

```
all the clocks in the city begin to whir and chime
oh! let not time deceive you, you cannot conquer time
in headaches and in worry, vaguely life leaks away
and time will have its fancy, tomorrow or today
```
