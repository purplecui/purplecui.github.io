 We sat in a cafe, opposite to each other talking about things: about life, our choices and our circumstances and hopeless of them all; love. We each suffer from same fate, same tragedy; unrequited love. The only difference being all mine was for her and hers for another man. Both hopeless romantics contemplating this deadlock in which we see no any path forward. Our feelings and emotions stuck in void and frozen in time eternal. i said to her,"what a tragedy, you are lucky and i am an artist. What can a worse combination be but this. To love is an art and to be loved is luck." She looked at me a while, her big beautiful eyes and with the same beautiful iciness said, "There is no great art without sadness and no lucky person is ever fulfilled."
